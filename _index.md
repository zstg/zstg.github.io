## Hi, I'm ZeStig!

Welcome to my little corner of the internet!

I'm a Linux nerd, emacs enthusiast, and a proponent of free and open-source software (FOSS). 
I love tweaking [my NixOS config](https://gitlab.com/zstg/nixos-config).

Once in a while, I write about the things that I am passionate about, including technology, Linux, and low level software.
My goal is to share my views and experiences on these topics, and help inform others who are interested in learning more.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy reading my articles and find them useful.
