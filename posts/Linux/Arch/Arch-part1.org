Installing Arch is not hard at all, it's quite simple to do. Arch has long been known as a power-users' distro, and Arch users are usually elitists. Today, we'll break that notion! 

Let's learn how to install Arch manually!

* Step 1: Download the Arch ISO

Download the Arch ISO from [here](https://archlinux.org/download). You can also download it from a mirror in your country for faster download speeds.

* Step 2: Boot into the Arch ISO

Create a fresh VM and boot into the Arch ISO that you've downloaded. Alternatively, you can flash the image to a USB and boot from it. The ISO file will automatically boot into a shell. You can type =clear= to clear the screen.

* Step 3: Set the Time and Date

Run the following command to set the time and date:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
timedatectl set-ntp true
#+END_SRC

* Step 4: Partition the Virtual Hard Drive
This step requires =parted=, so install it if it isn't available in the live environment: =sudo pacman -S parted=.
Partition your virtual hard drive using the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
parted /dev/sda -- mklabel gpt # THIS WILL WIPE YOUR DEVICE, don't do this if you're dual-booting!
parted /dev/sda -- mkpart ESP fat32 1MB 512MB # 512 MB bootloader
parted /dev/sda -- mkpart primary ext4 512MB 100% # rem space for the root filesystem
parted /dev/sda -- set 1 esp on # make the partition bootable
#+END_SRC

* Step 5: Format the Partitions

Format the partitions that you've created:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1 -n boot
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2 -L root
#+END_SRC

If you've created a btrfs filesystem, use the following command instead:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
mkfs.btrfs /dev/sda2 -L root
#+END_SRC

* Step 6: Mount the Partitions

Mount the partitions to your filesystem:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
mount --mkdir /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot # if you've using BIOS
mount --mkdir /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot/efi # if you're using UEFI
#+END_SRC

* Step 7: Install Base Arch Stuff

Install the base Arch stuff onto your install. This process can take â‰ˆ 10-15 min depending on your internet connection:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
pacstrap /mnt base-devel linux linux-firmware # linux-firmware is optional inside a VM...
# IF YOU'RE ON A NON-SOYSTEMD DISTRO SUCH AS ARTIX
basestrap /mnt base-devel linux elogind-openrc
#+END_SRC

* Step 8: Set Hostname

Add a hostname to your VM:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
genfstab -L /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab # use labels to identify em
# fstabgen  -L /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab # on Artix
modprobe efivarfs
arch-chroot /mnt # artix-chroot /mnt bash 
#+END_SRC

Choose a proper timezone and set the hostname:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Chicago /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
echo Arch-VM > /etc/hostname # replace with a hostname of your choice, preferably no spaces
#+END_SRC

Install the nano text editor:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
pacman -S  nano --noconfirm
#+END_SRC

* Step 9: Configure /etc/hosts

Edit the =/etc/hosts= file and add the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
127.0.0.1   localhost
::1         localhost
127.0.1.1   arch.localdomain arch # REPLACE arch WITH YOUR HOSTNAME!!!
#+END_SRC

* Step 10: Set Root Password

Set the password for the root user:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
passwd
#+END_SRC

* Step 11: Add User

Add a user (add them to required groups) and set a password for the user:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
useradd -m stig -G wheel,input,audio,video,optical,storage && passwd stig
#+END_SRC

Add the user to the wheel group in the =/etc/sudoers= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
EDITOR=nano visudo
#+END_SRC

Uncomment the following line in the =/etc/sudoers= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
#+END_SRC

* Step 12: Install Bootloader

|      | Systemd-boot | GRUB |
| BIOS | N            | Y    |
| UEFI | Y            | Y    |

Install the bootloader:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish
pacman -S grub efibootmgr os-prober
#+END_SRC

Note that os-prober is optional, but can be useful to troubleshoot dual-boot systems. You need not install it inside a VM, or when you're not dual-booting.

Then install the bootloader to the right place - you can choose between Grub and Systemd-boot.
** Grub 
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
 grub-install # --target=x86_64-efi --bootloader-id=grub_uefi --recheck 
#+END_SRC

Now we need to generate a grub config file.
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
#+END_SRC
** Systemd-boot
#+BEGIN_SRC fish
bootctl install
#+END_SRC
Open =/etc/fstab= and note the *UUID* of the partition mounted at =/= (=root= or =/dev/sda2= in this case).

Now create =/boot/loader/entries/arch.conf= with the following content:
#+BEGIN_SRC ini
title Arch Linux
linux /vmlinuz-linux
initrd /intel-ucode.img 
initrd /initramfs-linux.amg
options root=<UUID obtained above> rw
#+END_SRC
NOTE: *Replace with* =amd-ucode.img= *if you have an AMD processor*.

* Step 13: Finish the install
Get a networking daemon set up:
#+BEGIN_SRC fish 
pacman -S networkmanager --noconfirm
systemctl enable NetworkManager
# Replace accordingly if you're running a non-soystemd distro
#+END_SRC

Leave the arch-chroot; installation's almost over.

=exit=

Finally unmount the live USB: =umount -l /mnt && exit=

Shut down the VM: =shutdown now=

The virtual machine has been shut down , eject the ISO file (remove the USB if you're performing the installation on bare metal).
When the VM has finished booting up once more, login into the tty by typing your username and password.

Now we install a desktop.

Choose which DE you need from [this link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_environment).

 If you want a [display manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_manager) such as [SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm), you can set it up as well:

#+BEGIN_SRC fish 
sudo pacman -S sddm --noconfirm
sudo systemctl enable sddm # will autostart the service from next boot onwards
# Replace accordingly if you're running a non-soystemd distro
#+END_SRC
Now that the Arch install **has _finished_**, simply reboot your system using the =reboot= command.
